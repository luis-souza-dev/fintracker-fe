# Fintracker
My goal is to build my own financial tracker to help me keep mine and my wife's finance in check. The idea is to receive the income and spendings from both residents and build charts/reports
for us to analyze and see how we can save more money. In the long run I wish to add the ability to set our goals and do sum estimatives on when we'll be able to achieve then based on our spending habits.
This is supposed to be the first step of my plan to build my own multi-purpose helper.

## Future Scope

 - [ ] Create dashboards to display our spending tendencies and add estimates for future months
 - [ ] Add a "Goals" section, where I'll be able to set my next goals and define how much I need to save monthly to achieve it
 - [ ] Generate reports for tax purposes
